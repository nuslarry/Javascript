//Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope 
//(to the top of the current script or the current function).

//JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted


//example1 :
<script>
var age=23;
function foo(){
	var age=65;
    console.log(age)
}
foo();
console.log(age);
</script>
